In Go, everything is passed by value â€” including structs, slices, and maps. But the value itself may contain a reference, which is where things get interesting.


map crud(ADD, DELETE, UPDATE, GET)
loop through using for range

if key not available then return nil not error

nested map

map with struct

struct to map


i can use comparable as key

maps are referenece types within funcs


join two map into one, merge map


multiple goroutines access same key return nil for that use sync.Map

concurrency map
sync.Map
